# Coding-Problems

Contains solved problems implemented in Java, C++, and Python for coding problems on LeetCode, Topcoder, and HackerRank and problems from CLRS intro to algorithms book. 

Although I am thoughtful about error checking/handling, I am not overly concerned about it. As such, I have not put a lot of effort into 'pristine' (if I may) error checking. My focus for these problems is learning the ideas and concepts behind each algorithm with the goal of becoming very good at synthesizing my own algorithms
