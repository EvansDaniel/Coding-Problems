/**
 *      Recursive function calls requires saving the
 *      variable data in each call. Writing this information
 *      to the stack and popping it from the stack makes it  a
 *      little less efficient than iteration, not to mention the
 *      fact that recursive calls take up a lot of memory on the
 *      stack
 *
 *      Tail recursion refers to a recursive call in the last line of
 *      a function. It can be replaced by a loop with one assignment per
 *      function argument.
